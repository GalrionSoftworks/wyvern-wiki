## Chatting with an AI model

It's normal for people new to this kind of platform to be unsure about what it means to roleplay with an AI model.
By oversimplyfying things, interacting with an AI model means speaking with a very intelligent machine, that will dynamically generate its answer depending on:
1) What it was instructed to do.
2) What you asked of it.

The set of instructions given to the machine is also commonly known as 'system prompt', and is used to state what is the AI's purpose and how it should act to accomplish it.

In more common applications like ChatGPT, system prompts usually begin with phrases like "You're an helpful AI assistant...", followed by various guidelined to direct how it should answers the user's questions, what kind of content the AI can and cannot generate, etc.

In roleplaying applications like WyvernChat, system prompts usually begin with phrases like: "Currently, your role is *Character*, described in detail below. As *Character*, continue the never-ending roleplay with the user..."

This might not look like a big difference at first glance, but it's able to completely shift the perspective in which the AI looks at what comes after. The AI understands that it must try to fully embody the character used in the roleplay, speaking and acting like that character would.

#Character's card

If the system prompt is used to instruct the AI to act like a method actor, the character card is used to give the AI informations about the character it should roleplay as. On WyvernChat, cards can be viewed in the 'Characters' section of the website
